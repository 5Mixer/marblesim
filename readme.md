## Marblesim
A marble physics simulator built with Haxe, Kha, Nape, hxWebSockets and Node.

Currently live at https://danielblaker.com/marblesim (25/6/21)

To collaborate, add a # and a room name to the end of the URL. The default, hash-less room does not persist.

 - Worked well for 40+ concurrent users on a $5/month VPS
 - Cross-platform thanks to Kha: Runs natively with C++ or in the browser with JS
 - Support for real-time collaboration, including visible collaborative cursors.
 - A variety of tiles: accelerators, springs, slopes.
 - Colour variations of marbles and tiles
